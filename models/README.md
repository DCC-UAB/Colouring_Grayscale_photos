This folder contains the different models we have trained and tested. Some are simpler, others more complex and some give us better results than others.
### `models.py`
This file contains the definition of the `ConvNet` model, which is a simple convolutional neural network model.
### `modelAutoencoder.py`
This file contains the definition of the `modelAutoencoder` model, which is a model with an autoencoder architecture using convolutional layers for the encoder and decoder.
