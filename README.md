# Colouring grayscale photos
In this project, we aim to develop a program that can automatically colorize black and white images using deep neural networks. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can teach our model to understand the context and semantics of images, enabling it to generate plausible and aesthetically pleasing colorizations. The primary objective of this project is to design and train a deep neural network model capable of accurately predicting and assigning appropriate color values to grayscale images. This involves teaching the model to understand various visual features, textures, and patterns present in colored images to produce realistic and visually coherent colorizations. Ultimately, our goal is to develop an efficient and effective system that can save significant time and effort for digital artists and photographers.

## Code structure
You must create as many folders as you consider. You can use the proposed structure or replace it by the one in the base code that you use as starting point. Do not forget to add Markdown files as needed to explain well the code and how to use it.

## Example Code
The given code is a simple CNN example training on the MNIST dataset. It shows how to set up the [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)  package to monitor how your network is learning, or not.

Before running the code you have to create a local environment with conda and activate it. The provided [environment.yml](https://github.com/DCC-UAB/XNAP-Project/environment.yml) file has all the required dependencies. Run the following command: ``conda env create --file environment.yml `` to create a conda environment with all the required dependencies and then activate it:
```
conda activate xnap-example
```

To run the example code:
```
python main.py
```
